This project is an initiative to provide a Virtual Lab Platform for SRMIST. It's divided into two parts as of now, the client application (the one you're currently in) and a [service application](https://github.com/kunalkeshan/SRMIST-VLab-Service) to fetch subject and experiment details from the database.
